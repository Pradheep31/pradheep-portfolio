        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Pradheep G, an aspiring web developer with a passion for building beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I recently started my journey into web development and I'm currently learning core technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.</p>
        <p>I enjoy transforming ideas into real projects and continuously improving my coding skills through hands-on practice. I have a growing interest in front-end development and UI/UX design, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities the web has to offer.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I love exploring new tech trends, reading about software development, and watching tutorials to stay inspired and up to date.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring something newâ€”whether it's a technology, a tool, or a creative idea. I also take time to refresh my mind by going for walks, listening to music, or simply reflecting to recharge and stay focused.</p>

            <h4>Thiraipadam - Movie Platform (Group Project)</h4>
            <p>Thiraipadam is a collaborative project where we built a movie-watching platform focused on clean visuals and easy navigation. I was responsible for designing the movie card layout, navigation structure, and enhancing the visual styling. This project taught me how to share responsibilities in a team and maintain design consistency across different sections. We worked together to ensure a polished and intuitive end-user experience.</p>
